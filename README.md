## About me  
Hi Everyone, welcome to my Github, I am Sophie. 
I'm a PhD student in the department of molecular cell biology. My mentor is Prof. Tami Geiger and we research cancer proteomics. 
Specificallly I am interested in understanding the tumor microenvironment of primary and metastatic colorectal cancer. 

## Technology
In our lab we do mass spectrometry based proteomics. This means that we digest the proteins using enzymes and then we run the peptides in a machine called mass spec which allows us to identify and quantify the proteins in our sample.
