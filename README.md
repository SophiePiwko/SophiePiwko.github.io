## :sunflower: About me 
Hi Everyone, welcome to my Github, I am Sophie. 

I'm a PhD student in the department of molecular cell biology. 

My mentor is Prof. Tami Geiger and we research cancer proteomics. 

Specificallly I am interested in understanding the tumor microenvironment of primary and metastatic colorectal cancer. 

## :trophy: Technology
In our lab we do mass spectrometry based proteomics. This means that we digest the proteins using enzymes and then we run the peptides in a machine called mass spec which allows us to identify and quantify the proteins in our sample. 

## :books: Education
**Ph.D.** - ongoing, Molecular Cell Biology, WIS 

**M.Sc.** - Molecular Cell Biology, WIS 

**B.Sc.** - Biotechnology, Bar Ilan University
